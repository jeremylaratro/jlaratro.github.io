                <p class="lead-text">
                    The uSDX is a credit card-sized fully operational HF radio capable of modulating SSB (USB and LSB), as well as CW. There are multiple versions of this project. This one was created by Manuel, DL2MAN, and the software originally by Guido, PE1NNZ. I also built one of the other original versions by Barb, WB2CBA.

                <h2 class="section-title">THE BUILD EXPERIENCE</h2>
                <p>
                    This is one of my favorite open source projects to date, as the community was quite small and I was able to help, as well as be helped, by others. A lot of knowledge and experience was shared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specifically, a problem arose where a number of people were receiving ATMEGA328P microcontrollers without bootloaders. I made a guide for them to successfully load the bootloader onto their microcontroller via the command prompt, using a breadboard and USB-ASP. This then allowed them to upload the uSDX firmware via their Arduino's.

                <h2 class="section-title">TECHNICAL CHALLENGES</h2>
                <p>
                    This project consisted of many parts, and was a great learning experience. The RF filter board was especially interesting, as it was my first introduction into Class E amplifiers and serial resonance. This made it quite a challenge, but was extremely rewarding, as the values for each frequency band had to be optimized while maintaining that optimization for all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did this using a VNA and LC Meter. The board was designed by Manuel, DL2MAN, to allow for five frequency bands, and each pair of toroids had to be tuned to the correct frequency band, which was done by changing the number of times the magnet wire was wrapped around the toroid, as well as the capacitor values.
